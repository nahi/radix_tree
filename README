radix_tree - Naive implementation of Radix Tree for Ruby
Copyright (C) 2012 Hiroshi Nakamura <nahi@ruby-lang.org>

My intention is using Radix Tree instead of Hash for parsing external input
to avoid DoS via Algorithmic Complexity Attacks.


== Performance

* 20 times slower for 10 bytes key, 100000 elements insertion
* 10 times slower for 10 bytes key, 100000 elements retrieval


== TODO

See comments in lib/radix_tree.rb


== History

 * 1.0.0 - Initial release.
 * 1.1.0 - 1.8 support, speed/memory perf improvement.
 * 1.2.0 - Hash methods implemented by Leeheng. Thanks!
